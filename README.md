## Projects

### Katarina

The DLL's that you inject into either LeagueClient or LeagueClientUx.

### Spellthief

Tries to give files dumped with LeagueClient's `libzstd-ZSTD_decompress-dump` a sensible name.

### Xayah

Downloads the API documentation (which btw is also accessible with Swagger UI afaik). Get password and port with LeagueClientUx's `libcef-cef_parse_url-print`. Gives a lot of duplicate content (and it probably misses some stuff).
